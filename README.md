Dilraj Randhawa:
I worked on the following tasks:

1. Integrated Redis for Session Storage in Production – This task involved replacing the in-memory session store with Redis using hono-sessions-redis and ioredis. This change ensures persistent session storage across multiple instances of the application.
2. Updated Middleware for Redis-based Authentication – Modified the authentication and session validation middleware to fetch user session data from Redis instead of a local in-memory store. This improves scalability and consistency in handling user sessions.
3. Configured Environment Variables for Redis – Updated the server configuration to load Redis connection settings (host, port, password) from environment variables, making it adaptable for different deployment environments.
